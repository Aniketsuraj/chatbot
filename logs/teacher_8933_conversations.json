They're also performing well, with a score of 68.67. Class 8a is also doing well, with a progress score of 46.53 and a performance score of 66.74. However, class 8e seems to be struggling a bit more, with a progress score of 35.98 and a performance score of 76.01. It looks like they might need some extra support.\n\nRecommendation:\nIt seems like class 8e could benefit from some targeted review of the topics covered. Perhaps revisiting foundational concepts or offering small group instruction could help them catch up. Also, consider looking at the types of activities and assessments used in class 8e to see if adjustments could improve student engagement and understanding.",
